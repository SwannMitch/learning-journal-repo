# About Markdown

Markdown is a simple way to style text on the Internet. It is primarily used by Github, Reddit, and others due to it's focus on readability.

For instance, you can change the text emphasis by making items **bold** or _italicized_.
Bold text by using two asterisks or two underscores. Italicize text using one asterisk or one underscore.
```
**bold**
_italicized_
```

## You can also format text in different ways using headers, links, lists, and tables.

**Headers:**  
You can create headers using '# New header'.
The different header fonts go from the largest with '#' to the smallest with '######'
```
### New header 
```
_Becomes:_
### New header 

**Unordered lists:**
```
- An unordered (bulleted) list
```
_Becomes:_
- An unordered (bulleted) list

**Ordered lists:**  
If you want your text ordered:  
```
1. Use a number
2. Followed by a period
2. You can repeat numbers
5. The order doesnt matter.
```
_Becomes:_

**With tables:**  

```
|First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
|:---  | :---: | ---:  |
|left aligned |   centered    | right aligned |
|row 2 cell 1 | row 2 cell 2  | row 2 cell 3 |
```

_Becomes:_

|First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
|:---  | :---: | ---:  |
|left aligned |   centered    | right aligned |
|row 2 cell 1 | row 2 cell 2  | row 2 cell 3 |

*Notice the row in between the headers and cells of the table determines the alignment of the text in the columns with the placement semicolons on the sides of hyphens.

**Links:**  
If you want create a link, to my homepage for example, it would look like this
```
https://swannmitch.github.io/learning-journal-repo/  
or  
[Home](https://swannmitch.github.io/learning-journal-repo/)
```
_Becomes:_  
https://swannmitch.github.io/learning-journal-repo/  
or  
[Home](https://swannmitch.github.io/learning-journal-repo/)  
*Notice how the text in the brackets is now a hyperlink for the source.

# How Computers Work!

Based on the [playlist by Code.Org](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-), here are my 3 most significant learnings:

#### What makes a computer, a computer

> It's amazing to me that from the very first computer, to even the most modern, enthusiast computers, they still execute 4 basic tasks:

- Input
- Process
- Storage
- Output

#### Binary & Data

> I know a little about bits and bytes, I've heard of binary code (and watched the Matrix), but I didn't know how information displayed. Especially photos, videos, graphics, and sound as binary code.

#### Hardware & Software

> I've been into both hardware and software for as long as I remember. It's cool seeing how different peripherals can have inputs and outputs and they those themselves are made up of binary code.

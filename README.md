## Growth Mindset

### Here's what a growth mindset means to me:

- Setting Goals
- Embracing the Struggle
- Using it to Fuel Your Ambitions 
- Perservering and Succeeding

### Here's how I can remind myself to keep a growth mindset.  

1. Believe in Myself
2. Remain Humble
3. Accept challenges and Struggles as Part of the Process

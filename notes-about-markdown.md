# About Markdown

Markdown is a simple way to style text on the Internet. It is primarily used by Github, Reddit, and others due to it's focus on readability.

For instance, you can create headers using '# New header'.
The different header fonts go from the largest with '#' to the smallest with '######'
```
# New header 
```
_Becomes_
# New header 

You can also format text in different ways using lists, tables, and even adding emphasis.

Unordered lists:
- An unordered (bulleted) list
```
- An unordered (bulleted) list
```


With tables

```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | :-----------:
row 1 cell 1 | row 1 cell 2
row 2 cell 1 | row 2 cell 2
```

Becomes:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | :-----------:
row 1 cell 1 | row 1 cell 2
row 2 cell 1 | row 2 cell 2

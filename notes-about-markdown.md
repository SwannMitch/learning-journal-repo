# About Markdown

Markdown is a simple way to style text on the Internet. It is primarily used by Github, Reddit, and others due to it's focus on readability.

For instance, you can create headers using '# New header'.
# New header

The different header fonts go from the largest with '#' to the smallest with '######'

You can also format text in different ways using lists, tables, and even adding emphasis.

With lists:
- You can make an unordered (bulleted) list using '- or *'
or
1. Make an ordered list using '1., 2., etc'

With tables

'''
First Header | Second Header
------------ | :-----------:
row 1 cell 1 | row 1 cell 2
row 2 cell 1 | row 2 cell 2'
''' 

Becomes:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | :-----------:
row 1 cell 1 | row 1 cell 2
row 2 cell 1 | row 2 cell 2

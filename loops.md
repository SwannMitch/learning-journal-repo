# Lots of Loops

#### Here are some terminology about loops:

- == (is equal to)
    - compares two values to see if they are the same
- != (is not equal to)
    - compares two values to see if they are not the same
- === (strict equal to)
    - compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same
- !== (strict not equal)
    - compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same
- \> (greater than)
    - checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right
- \> (less than)
    - checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right
- \>= (greater than or equal to)
    - check if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right
- \<= (less than or equal to)
    - check if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right
- conditional statement
    - says what to do in a given situation (if, then, else)
- logical operators
    - allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator
- && (logical and)
    - tests more than one condition
- \|| (logical or)
    - tests at least one condition
- ! (logical not)
    - takes a single Boolean value and inverts it
- for loop
    - used to run code a specifc number of times using a counter as a condition
- while loop
    - used to run code unspecified number of times as long as the condition is true
- do while loop
    - will always run the statements at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false
